mean , sd, variance, skewness (symetry of datapoints), entropy (randomness in the signal) , 
rms value (magnitude of continous quanitity), minimum and maximum value of each channel, 
energy, median absolute deviation, interquartile range, semi quartile range, kurtosis (tailedness of distribution)

- seizure detection most effective using CNN 
- need spectograms of the eeg for a CNN
CNN: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2018.04.021

preprocessing discussed: 
- review states that for seizure detection we need to use signal values as opposed to calculated features 
- feed raw signal values into the NN

review paper: 
- proposes that the features extracted heavily impact the performance of the classifier 
1. time domain features - mean var, mode, median, skewness, kurtosis, min and max values,  
rms, energy, total vertical length of the line, different kinds of entropy (perfumation, fuzzy and weighted permutation)
2. freq domain - energy for some specified freq ranges, intensity weighted mean frequency, intensity weighted bandwidth,
specral edge frequency, spectral entropy,
