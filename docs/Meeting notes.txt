Notes from Fred
- segment samples for seizure and non-seizure
- only analyze segments with total voter agreement
- make subsegments to increase the number of samples for seizures
- drop participants with 0 seizures
- next step is preprocessing the eeg signals - will be covered in the next lecture
- first try feature extraction and classic ml classifiers (enough for the scope of the project)
- try applying classifiers / ideas from harvard kaggle comp (advanced)
- discover the dataset further

Ask Fred whats next?

Next steps
- Preprocessing
- EDF to npy
- npy to segments
- feauter extraction
- model selection
