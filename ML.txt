(authored by a creator of the neonatal seizure dataset and contains analysis of that dataset)

Summary
Class imbalance is not a problem in neonatal seizure detection, due to higher seizure to non-seizure ratio. Unlike it is a problem in adult seizure detection.

When training the SDA, it is noted that there is a preponderance of data in the non-seizure class compared to seizure class 
(458796 non-seizure epochs vs 20373 seizure epochs [16]). 
Class imbalance in the databases has been shown to be a problem when constructing adult SDAs [26].
However, this is not as significant a problem in neonatal SDAs, particularly SVM based methods,
where seizures are more prevalent and the process of annotation is more concerned with false positives (seizures) than false negatives [19,27].

Summary
Multiple annotators
Train a model for each annotator
Make ansamble

---
The dataset used for this study is annotated by three experts and as such three separate models are trained on individual annotations, 
resulting in average accuracies (ACC) of 95.6 %, 94.8 % and 90.1 % respectively, 
and average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 99.2 %, 98.4 % and 96.7 % respectively. 
The testing was done using 10-cross fold validation, 
so that the performance can be an accurate representation of the architectures classification capability in a clinical setting. 
After training/testing of the three individual models, a final ensemble model is made consisting of the three models. 
The ensemble model gives an average ACC and AUC of 96.3 % and 99.3 % respectively.

Summary
(Highest accuracy model)
The 12 features of {median, maximum, minimum, mean, mode, range, first quartile, second quartile, standard deviation, variation, skewness, kurtosis}
are considered as the key features to represent EEG data in this study.
