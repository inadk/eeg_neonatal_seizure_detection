Summary
Class imbalance is not a problem in neonatal seizure detection, due to higher seizure to non-seizure ratio. Unlike it is a problem in adult seizure detection.

When training the SDA, it is noted that there is a preponderance of data in the non-seizure class compared to seizure class 
(458796 non-seizure epochs vs 20373 seizure epochs [16]). 
Class imbalance in the databases has been shown to be a problem when constructing adult SDAs [26].
However, this is not as significant a problem in neonatal SDAs, particularly SVM based methods,
where seizures are more prevalent and the process of annotation is more concerned with false positives (seizures) than false negatives [19,27].
